👋🏽!Hey there! I'm Ricardo, a Biotechnologist and computational biologist from Colombia. Learn more about me [here](https://ricardorh96.github.io/ricardorivero-website/)

I am currently a 👨🏽‍🎓 Ph.D. Student at Seifert Lab at Washington State University, I am also a Lighthouse Scholar at the [VERENA Project](https://www.viralemergence.org/)

🦠My research interests include Arboviruses, Coronaviruses, and RNA viruses as a whole. I dream of a world where public health interventions will be precisely informed by data, shaping impactful policies that contain and control pathogens.
